Recipies website project

This is my first official webstie project built under The Odin Project curriculum.
In this project I will be demonstrating my ability to use the command line to structure
project folders and data, an understanding of basic HTML concepts in designing a basic 
website, and showing my ability to manage a project through git version control.
